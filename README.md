# FOFlow: Personalized ADHD Productivity and Focus Coach

## Overview

FOFlow is an innovative, AI-enhanced productivity coach designed specifically to assist adults with ADHD in managing their daily tasks, improving focus, and tracking progress through evidence-based, neurodivergent-friendly features.

This project was developed to capture and analyze medical data related to neurological conditions.
